# NeurIPS 2021 Competition on Approximate Inference in Bayesian Deep Learning

This covers the [NeurIPS 2021 Bayesian deep learning competition](https://izmailovpavel.github.io/neurips_bdl_competition/) mentioned in Section 4.2.4 and Appendix D.3.

## Download the competition data

Run `bash download_data.sh`to download the data from the [official competition website](https://izmailovpavel.github.io/neurips_bdl_competition/).

## Run IVON on the three competition datasets

- CIFAR-10 `bash run_cifar10.sh`
- MedMNIST `bash run_medmnist.sh`
- UCI `bash run_uci.sh`

After running these scripts, the results can be found `results.txt` in the `results_cifar10`, `results_medmnist`, `results_uci` folders.
